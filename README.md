# auth-server
This auth-server allows a user to create an account via github Oauth or signup the old fashioned way.
It also allows for varying roles to be assigned to each user that each have corresponding permissions for example, 'write' privileges allow the user to hit the create route as well as the read route, while the 'editor' role admits the user to create, read, and update routes.
